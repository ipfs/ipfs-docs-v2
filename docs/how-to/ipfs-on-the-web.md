# IPFS on the web

## Challenges with IPFS on the Web

One of the main benefits of IPFS is that CIDs allow you to fetch data from anyone **trustlessly** through hash verification. This foundation enables IPFS to function as a permissionless peer-to-peer network. 

However, making all of this work on the web is tricky. While web browsers have the widest proliferation as an application runtime, they impose many restrictions on what web pages can do. For example, a web page cannot just open TCP/UDP connections. It is mostly constrained to HTTP, WebSockets, WebRTC, and most recently WebTransport. There are good reasons for this like security and resource management, but ultimately, it means that **using IPFS on the Web is different to IPFS in native binaries.**

Thus, the Web is both a **resource-constrained and API-constrained** environment. So practically everything on this page is applicaable

## Onboarding, Retrieving, and Providing

Ultimately, there are three things that you do with IPFS:
- Onboard data, i.e. take arbitrary data, chunk it, and structure it as a Merkle DAG represented by a single CID. 
- Retrieve files and arbitrary data. Given a CID, you use IPFS to find providers (peers who share the block), connect to them *somehow*, fetch the blocks, and verify from peers who have the CID. Once that's all done, you save the block locally. 
- Provide the block to others.

### You probably don't want to rely on the web for providing

Browsers make for lousy servers. It's almost impossible to make a web page "dialable", i.e. allow other computers to connect to it (the exception is WebRTC with many caveats). 

For this reason, for CIDs to it's recommended to delegate providing to an external server that runs reliably and has a public IP. That can be a Kubo node that you run, or a [pinning service](../concepts/persistence.md#pinning-services). 

## Onboarding

Even when relying on another server for providing, it's recommended to handle chunking and Merkle-DAG construction locally in the browser and uploading a [CAR file](../concepts/glossary.md#car). This reduces the trust surface and allows you to know the CID ahead of the upload.
